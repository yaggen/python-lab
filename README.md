# python-lab
Three weeks of Python Labs during a computer science course at University West fall 2019.

# Lab.py
Simple exersice featuring if-loops, strings and functions. 

#Lab_b.py
Another exersice focusing on flow control with loops, also some focusing on lists and printing results

#Lab_c.py
Rather advanced exersice, we were supposed to parse trough a set of cisco config and version files, take out relevant info and put it into a
HTML-table. The program can be rewritten and continued on to make a simple tool for documenting networking software at a workplace.
